# Maya Python plugin template

A template to quickly make a Python plugin for Maya. (For modules, see [Maya module template](https://github.com/hannesdelbeke/maya-module-template)  

## Features
- simple installation
    - Drag & drop installation with `installer.mel`. (Windows only)
    - it installs the Python plugin
    - and it installs all Python dependencies (scripts) from https://pypi.org/
- Easily enable / disable a tool with the plug-in manager. Smoothly disable your tools if they cause issues.

- Run startup code, without editing `userSetup.py`, keeping your Maya setup clean. (great for debugging)
- Adds your tool to the Maya menu when plugin enabled, and remove from menu when unloaded

- Support MPXCommands (beta)

## Overview

#### handle dependencies automatically
A pip install auto handles dependencies, removing the need for vendoring dependencies.  
Without pip install you need to manually install the dependencies.  
This template includes a `pyproject.toml` to support a pip install to a Maya plugin folder.  
The below command triggers a pip install from this repo:
```
pip install https://github.com/hannesdelbeke/maya-plugin-template/archive/refs/heads/main.zip --target "C:/Users/%username%/Documents/Maya/plug-ins"
```
<details>
<summary>Read this if the above command fails</summary>

<sup>_1. if the target folder doesn't exist, this command creates a `Maya/plug-ins` folder in your documents , which requires admin access._</sup>  
<sup>_2. When a user has been renamed on Windows, `%username%` will return the current name. But the folder path will use the old name, resulting in this demo command failing._</sup>  
</details>
Maya plugins don't support Python packages, they only support a single `.py` file.  
To include a package in your plugin, I recommend to use pip dependencies.

the drag and drop installer uses requirements.txt to install dependencies. and installs them to `documents/maya/scripts`.


## Instructions
- click ðŸŸ©`use this template` to create your GitHub repo, & clone it
- change the data in the `pyproject.toml`
- add dependencies to both `requirements.txt` and `pyproject.toml`
- Plugin setup
  - rename the demo plugin folder
  - change the `MENU_NAME` and other menu variables at the top of the file to customize the tool's menu entry.
  - add load & unload code to the `initializePlugin` & `uninitializePlugin` methods
      - `initializePlugin` & `uninitializePlugin` don't follow the PEP8 name convention. Do not change this, or they won't run.
  - optionally handle command registration on load & unload 
- Optional
  - replace this `README.md` with your own instructions
  - Add a LICENSE
- edit the `installer.mel` to support drag and drop installation of your plugin. Change the variable at the top to your python script name. For drag & drop installation of your Maya plugin to `documents/maya/plug-ins`. Just drag the `installer.mel` file in Maya. (Windows only)

### Extras
<details>
<summary>see command info</summary>

You can add commands to you Maya plugin. Included this in the template but I never use this. Feel free to just delete all code related to commands.

Adding a command to your plugin is optional. (I never had the need for it)
In Maya Python scripting, MPxCommand is a base class for creating custom commands. Below is a simple example of creating a custom command using MPxCommand. This example demonstrates a command that creates a cube.

```python
import maya.api.OpenMaya as om
import maya.cmds as cmds

class CreateCubeCommand(om.MPxCommand):
    commandName = "createCube"

    def __init__(self):
        super(CreateCubeCommand, self).__init__()

    def doIt(self, args):
        # Parse the arguments if needed (not used in this example)

        # Create a cube
        cube = cmds.polyCube()[0]

        # Set the result to the name of the created cube
        self.setResult(cube)

# Creator function
def createCubeCommand():
    return om.asMPxPtr(CreateCubeCommand())

# Initialize the plugin
def initializePlugin(plugin):
    pluginFn = om.MFnPlugin(plugin)
    try:
        pluginFn.registerCommand(
            CreateCubeCommand.commandName,
            createCubeCommand
        )
    except:
        om.MGlobal.displayError(
            "Failed to register command: {}".format(
                CreateCubeCommand.commandName
            )
        )

# Uninitialize the plugin
def uninitializePlugin(plugin):
    pluginFn = om.MFnPlugin(plugin)
    try:
        pluginFn.deregisterCommand(CreateCubeCommand.commandName)
    except:
        om.MGlobal.displayError(
            "Failed to unregister command: {}".format(
                CreateCubeCommand.commandName
            )
        )

# Usage:
# 1. Save this script as "createCubeCmd.py"
# 2. Load the script in Maya using the following commands:
#    ```
#    import maya.cmds as cmds
#    cmds.loadPlugin("path/to/createCubeCmd.py")
#    ```
# 3. Run the custom command:
#    ```
#    cmds.createCube()
#    ```
```

- might consider adding: support for toolbox & shelf entries
- PS: You can also use [unimenu](https://github.com/hannesdelbeke/unimenu) to add your tool to the Maya menu. Recommended for more advanced studio setups.
